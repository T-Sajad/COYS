* load get-fixtures-en.json into the App.jsx
* console.log the fixture data

* print the fixture data into the App.jsx page (like <pre>{data}</pre>)
* For each fixture, render a div with the teams and scores
  (like <div>{`${teams.home.name} vs ${teams.away.name}`}</div>)
* For each fixture, include the score and style the names and scores nicely (use css! tailwind?)
* Group the fixtures by date
